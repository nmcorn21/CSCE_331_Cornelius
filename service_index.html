        <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
        <p>
            Currently I have the privilege of serving as the treasurer of a men’s organization on campus 
            that has a very deserving philanthropy. The organization I am a part of is called 
            <a href="https://www.paradigm-tamu.org/">Paradigm</a> and we 
            chose the philanthropy <a href="https://www.lls.org/">LLS</a>, better known as the 
            Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. This cause is very 
            near and dear to our organizations heart because of the way we originally started to support the cause. 
            One of the founding members of our organization was diagnosed with non hodgkin's lymphoma during his 
            time in college. The first philanthropy event our organization ever did was a movie night under the stars 
            to help pay for his treatment. Thankfully since his diagnosis he has been in remission and made a full 
            recovery. Since then we have stuck with LLS as our philanthropy to support this cause that is so near to 
            our hearts. Our first few years we put on Movie Night Under the Stars to raise money for LLS, and in the 
            last few years we have put on Rock ‘N’ Reel. At this event we have a few bands come out to perform and 
            then show a movie after the sun goes down. I am very pleased to tell you about this event as it has a huge 
            impact. Many of our members have family members affected by leukemia and lymphoma and it is still something 
            we hold near to our hearts. In the past few years we have raised over $30,000 to donate and we are working on 
            raising much more. To all of those reading this I hope that you would consider coming out to our philanthropy 
            event next spring to support our cause. Tickets are never that much to buy and they come with fun, free stuff, 
            and access to vendors. If you are interested at all follow 
            <a href="https://www.paradigm-tamu.org/rock-n-reel">Rock 'N' Reel</a> 
            and instagram to keep up with updates.
