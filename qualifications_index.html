        <p>MLP Technology Intern</p>
        <p>
            This past summer I worked at <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en.html">PwC</a>
            in downtown Dallas. During my time here I was assigned a full stack project to implement
            a statistics dashboard that would show our tax team how often their clients were utilizing different features
            that we offer them. Upon completion of my internship I had the basic functionality done. This project will help the team 
            save time that was previously spent having to query for this data manually.

        <p>Paradigm: Treasurer</p>
        <p>
            I am currently serving as the Treasurer for a men's organization of campus called Paradigm. This year I will manage a budget of 
            $30,000 in order to properly fund each committee to have a great year. Additionally, I work closely with various sponsors to 
            keep them updated on how our partnership is going. While doing this I work with the President and Vice President to create
            and execute a vision for the academic year.
